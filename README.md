## Credit Where Credit Is Due

All the work for this code and the libraries on which it depends are made possible by the fine work of [mikenemat](https://github.com/mikenemat) and [TheSourceLies](https://github.com/TheSourceLies). Mikenemat initially reverse engineered the protocols with which the lightpad and TheSourceLies created excellent documentation of the REST API for the Plum production web service.
